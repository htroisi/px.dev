## Updating content
The bulk of the content for this website lives under the [`src/pages` path](https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixielabs-website/tree/main/src/pages).
Some can also be found under [`content/pages`](https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixielabs-website/tree/main/content/pages).
Content under the latter path is written using [MDX Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/), and allows setting SEO-friendly metadata by putting a block like this at the top of the file:
```markdown
---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
metaDescription: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs for MDX content are generated automatically.
